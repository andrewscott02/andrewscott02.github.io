For the last month I have been working on my own game, Enfabler. I have been focused on getting the combat system in a good state and feeling polished and have now released a demo on itch.io. I am now working on getting a blockout for the first level, and I plan to show progress soon, but it is my first foray into level design so it is taking a lot of time. This devlog focuses on discussing the overall game concept and combat so far.

Enfabler is inspired by games like Fable, Medievil (not medieval) and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. In Enfabler, you play as a hero, who is aided by a famed storyteller. The storyteller aids you because they are searching for the perfect hero for their next big story, and is hoping that you are that hero. Prove you are more than an adventurer, uphold the highest standards of bravery and valour, and earn the right to become a hero. You will spend most of your time exploring dungeons, embarking on quests to earn fame and defeating powerful foes.

The third-person combat follows the hero in the thick of the fight, and you will use multiple weapons to fend off groups of powerful enemies or giant threats. To make the hero feel powerful, they may fight many enemies at once, or maybe 1 giant monster. A lot of time has been spent polishing the combat to make each attack feel powerful and punchy. To do this, I started out with some techniques that I have used in previous projects, like particle effects, screen shakes and slow motion. This was a good start, but I felt it was still a bit flat for this game and wanted something that would really sell the feeling of playing as a hero.

After a bit of research, I added ragdoll physics to killed enemies, which makes their deaths much more satisfying, as opposed to having them all play the same death animation or just *pop* out of existence. I then had to just disable all their AI and hit boxes so killed enemies would just fall over. The extra step to adding punch was to add a small impulse when you hit enemies so it looks like they have been hit rather than just flopping to the ground. I then experimented with a bit of animation freezing and controller rumble the instant a hit connects. This really excentuates that the player has hit something physical, as their weapon pauses and gets stuck for a split second. The player also gets some tactile feedback that lets them know they hit something. I also added some FOV changes when sprinting to make it feel a bit faster, and also added some very small screenshake on footsteps while sprinting to make the player feel like part of the world.
