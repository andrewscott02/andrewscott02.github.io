I have submitted Overkill for my first solo game jam. I've been wanting to make a game inspired by games like XCOM and to follow the theme of one hit, I decided to make a turn-based game where you cannot deal damage to enemies. 

In Overkill, characters can only die when they take damage that exceeds their armour, otherwise it has no effect. Use actions to increase the damage you can deal or decrease their armour first before unleashing an attack that can one-shot them.

This concept focuses on forcing the player to use strategies that increase their attack or decrease their enemies' defences so they can one-shot them. This design was intended to replicate the feeling of using combos in card games like Slay the Spire and Hearthstone to deal a high amount of damage and apply that to a game where you control a squad of characters.
