I have submitted Overkill for my first solo game jam. I've been wanting to make a game inspired by games like XCOM and to follow the theme of one hit, I decided to make a turn-based game where you cannot deal damage to enemies. 

In Overkill, characters can only die when they take damage that exceeds their armour, otherwise it has no effect. Use actions to increase the damage you can deal or decrease their armour first before unleashing an attack that can one-shot them.

This concept focuses on forcing the player to use strategies that increase their attack or decrease their enemies' defences so they can one-shot them. This design was intended to replicate the feeling of using combos in card games like Slay the Spire and Hearthstone to deal a high amount of damage and apply that to a game where you control a squad of characters.

To do this, I decided to have the players command a squad of demons invading Earth, as opposed to fighting them. They are strong and tough enough that they can kill standard infantry with one-hit and can survive their shots. However, tougher enemies, like super soldiers and vehicles would require more cunning. In this demo, you can control different characters that have their own methods of overcoming enemy armour. The Commander is a melee focused unit that gains armour when hit and not killed. It also has an attack that consumes his armour to deal damage, which involves a risk-reward playstyle where you position them near many weak enemies that can't deal enough damage to kill them and then sacrifice your defence to slay a powerful foe. The Shaman can curse enemies and empower allies with spells, providing battlefield control and support.

This demo was intended to test this game idea and practice my games development skills in a game jam. While I am no longer working on this project, I really like the concept and may return to it in the future.
