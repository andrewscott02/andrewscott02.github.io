  This controller aims to mimic game experiences from Table Top Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs) such as Dungeons & Dragons.
  
  The player will take turns moving their pieces on a physical boards, which will then move their pieces in a digital game. The player and an enemy AI will then take turns moving their pieces and casting spells until one of the teams have been defeated.
