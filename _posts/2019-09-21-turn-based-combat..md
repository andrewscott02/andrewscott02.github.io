## Details

Year 2 College Project | Game Engine - Unreal Engine 4 | 2019

<p>
  In my first programming project, I created a 2 player turn based game, modelled after TTRPG games. Players can take turns moving a character and casting spells.

In this project, I used the visual scripting blueprints in the Unreal Engine.
