Personal Project | Game Engine - Unity | 2023

[Submission for the UDC Jam #27](https://itch.io/jam/udc-jam-27/rate/2255113)

<p>
  Play as a raiding party of demons looking to take over the Earth for the forces of hell in this turn-based RPG with a twist.
</p>

<p>
  In Overkill, characters can only die when they take damage that exceeds their armour, otherwise it has no effect. Use actions to increase the damage you can deal or decrease their armour first before unleashing an attack that can one-shot them.
