                    <p>
                        I am a games programmer, specializing in gameplay and AI programming, and am looking to start a career in the Games industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy games as a means of interactive storytelling, and I aim to closely tie narrative in with game mechanics. Though I specialize in programming, I also branch out into design in order to better link storytelling with gameplay. Experience with design helps me to develop interesting and evocative gameplay mechanics that help tell the story through gameplay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a programmer, my specialism is in gameplay programming and artificial intelligence. I have experience with designing and implementing behaviour for NPCs and my current project is using AI techniques to procedurally generate levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have also worked in a lot of group projects (between 2 and 13 developers), and so I have experience working with a team to deliver games. We used agile methodologies such as scrum and tools like Trello to better organize the team.

                            <p>I have achieved a highly commended award for the Game of the Year mobile award from the Rookies in 2023 for our group student game, Battle for Arcana. Our game is a 2D deck-builder where you use Tarot cards to cast spells in combat and is a mobile counterpart to our PC game, Corruption of Arcana.</p>

                            <p>
                                I have completed BSc(Hons) Computing for Games and have been awarded a Second Class Honours (Upper Division) (2:1) classification at Falmouth University.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On this course, I've worked on games with teams of other students, developing both games development and team-working skills.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I've leveraged programming and design skills to create punchy and intuitive gameplay and better organised teamwork using agile methodologies such as scrum and kanban boards.
