            <h1 align="center"> My Experiences </h1>

            <p>
                I enjoy games as a means of interactive storytelling, and I aim to closely tie narrative in with game mechanics. Though I specialize in programming, I also branch out into design in order to better link storytelling with gameplay. Experience with design helps me to develop interesting and evocative gameplay mechanics that help tell the story through gameplay.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a programmer, my specialism is in gameplay programming and artificial intelligence. I have experience with designing and implementing behaviour for NPCs.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have also worked in a lot of group projects (between 2 and 13 developers), and so I have experience working with a team to deliver games. We used methodologies such as agile and scrum and tools such as Trello to better organize the team.
