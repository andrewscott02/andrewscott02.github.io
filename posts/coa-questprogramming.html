            <p>
                One of the most interesting features I worked on was the quest system and this was my first attempt at using recursion. While I didn't realise it at the time, I later discovered this use of recursion allows for more complex quest features, like branching quest paths, which were not possible with the first iteration of this system. With some polishing, this new and improved quest system offers designers much more freedom in quest design.
