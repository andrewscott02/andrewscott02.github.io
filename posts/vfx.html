            <p>
                University Project | Game Engine - Unity | 2021
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project, I developed two visual effects using custom shaders and procedural mesh elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first effect was a cartoon water effect that generates vertices and layers multiple sine waves to adjust the height of each vertex, which create a wave effect. The height of each vertex is also used to make small adjustments to the shader to provide a basic reflection effect, where the highest waves appear to have a brighter sheen than the lowest ones. There are other shaders layered over this colour adjustment that add an edge glow (composed of intersection glow and fresnel effect subgraphs) a foam effect and a foam effect, which makes a frothy effect on the surface and adds sparkles via a specs subgraph. There are public properties on the graphs that allow for changes, which I used to develop other liquid effects, such as lava and mud. This custom shader was used in our group project Corruption of Arcana.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second effect was a sword trail, that generates vertices and adjusts their position using a quadratic lerp function that generates a smooth curve behind the sword upon which the trail mesh is generated. There are shaders that make an uneven colouring and add specs along the sword trail and a tiling effect, which alters the opacity of the trail.
